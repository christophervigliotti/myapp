### Tuesday, April 9
Made it three pages into https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/ 

### Monday April 8
1. Installed VirtualBox
2. Created an Ubuntu 18.10 VirtualBox Appliance (see :Rails Install Notes section below)
3. Installed Ruby On Rails using these instructions https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/18.10 

#### Rails Install Notes
(see section 'Monday April 8' above for an overview of what I did)
* when using the gorails instructions, copy and paste each line and watch carefully for errors.  resolve them before you go onto copying and pasting the next line
* install locked up on rbenv, so I went with the rvm instructions
* don't remember how I resolved the "you must use bundler 2 or greater with this lockfile" issue (when creating myapp)
* created app using command rails new myapp -d postgresql

## MISCELLANEOUS

### Git

		example
			touch a_file.rb
			(creates empty file a_file.rb)
